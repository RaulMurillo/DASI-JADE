# DASI-SPADE
Project for DASI subject (UCM, course 2019-2020) consisting on a multi-agent system.

The system is developed with [SPADE platform](https://spade-mas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html), and makes use of a [XMPP server](https://xmpp.org/).

The main purpose is to develop a multi-agent system able to recognize food and ingredients from pictures and sugguest receipes that could be cooked with such ingredients.

## Instalation and dependencies

This software uses Python >= 3.6. You can install packages dependencies with `pip` as following:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Other considerations:
* There is no need to install any XMPP server if agents names are not modified.
* You will need Dialogflow credentials.
* The neural network model can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=19PA-QcdE7IBYzLSc-QPdXHSShHL3_G9y.
