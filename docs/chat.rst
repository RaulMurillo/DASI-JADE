Chat Agent
==========

The Chat Agent liaises between the Telegram bot, which receives user input, and the rest of the system. It is responsible for identifying the data entered, and forwarding it to the corresponding agent and in the appropriate format, as well as collecting the responses from the system and forwarding them to the bot so that they are displayed to the user.
